# F625---Methods-of-Scientific-Computation
This repository contains some codes of exercises done in a course of methods of scientific computation taken during my undergraduate studies at UNICAMP.

The book used during the discipline was "Computational Physics" from "Mark Newman".

The source codes of the exercises can be found in '/src/', divided by chapters. In the README of the folders of each chapter, there is a brief description of what was done in each exercise. The text of the exercises can be seen in '/references/' (they are available for free in the [author's website](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/)).

The follwing topics were studied in the course:
- **Chapter 5 - Integrals and derivatives:**
- **Chapter 6 - Solution of linear and nonlinear equations:**
- **Chapter 7 - Fourier transforms:**
- **Chapter 8 - Ordinary differential equations:**
- **Chapter 9 - Partial differential equations:**
- **Chapter 10 - Random processes and Monte Carlo methods:**

# F625---Methods-of-Scientific-Computation
This repository contains some codes of exercises done in a course of methods of scientific computation taken during my undergraduate studies at UNICAMP.

The book used during the discipline was "Computational Physics" by "Mark Newman".

The source codes of the exercises can be found in '/src/', divided by chapters. In the README of the folders of each chapter, there is a brief description of what was done in each exercise. The text of the exercises can be seen in '/references/' (they are available for free on the [author's website](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/cp/)).

The following topics were studied in the course:
- **Chapter 5 - Integrals and derivatives:** trapezoidal and Simpson's rules, error estimation on integrals, Romberg integration, Gaussian quadrature, Integrals over infinite ranges, multiple integrals, forward and backward differences, central differences, second derivatives, partial derivatives.
- **Chapter 6 - Solution of linear and nonlinear equations:** Gaussian elimination, relaxation method, Newton's method.
- **Chapter 7 - Fourier transforms:** discrete Fourier transform, discrete sine and cosine transforms, Fast Fourier Transform.
- **Chapter 8 - Ordinary differential equations:** Euler's method, Runge-Kutta method, fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, second-order differential equations, varying step size.
- **Chapter 9 - Partial differential equations:** boundary value problems, initial value problems, FTCS method, Crank-Nicolson method.
- **Chapter 10 - Random processes and Monte Carlo methods:** random numbers, Monte Carlo integration, Monte Carlo simulation, Markov chain, simulated annealing.

# Chapter 6 - Solution of linear and nonlinear equations

## Exercise 6.12:
In this exercise, we need to solve numerically the nonlinear equations that describe the process of breakdown of glucose in the body to release energy:
$$ \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{~d} t}=-x+a y+x^{2} y, \quad \frac{\mathrm{d} y}{\mathrm{~d} t}=b-a y-x^{2} y , $$
where $x$ and $y$ represents the concentrations of ADP and F6P, respectivelly, and $a$ and $b$ are positive constants.
